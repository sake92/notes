# Vagrant

VERY useful for LOCAL development.

You can configure a VM programmatically and boot it from command line.  

## Use cases
If your dev environment needs a particular VM setup, instead of a loooooong list of instructions,
you can *automate it* with Vagrant.

If you want to play around with various tools and *don't want to hurt your actual machine*, use a VM with Vagrant!  
For example, when you want to test Ansible, Puppet, or a software you downloaded from somewhere which you don't 100% trust, use Vagrant.
